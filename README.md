# FinalProject
My program is a game that lets the user play against the computer in a shootout. They are able to pick where they want to hide and where they want to attack. They are also able to pick the difficulty they wish to play on. 
No outside resources are used besides regex and random packages being imported.
This was a solo project, so I wrote all the code included in the program.
